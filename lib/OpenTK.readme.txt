OpenTK binaries were compiled from source files because of problems
in official distribution.

After the situation improves, I'm going to switch the system back to normal,
probably to the NuGet packaging (I hope it will work for both OpenTK and
OpenTK.GLControl).

OpenTK.support.zip
  contains additional optional files" XML documentation and debugging info.
  You can unzip it if you want.
