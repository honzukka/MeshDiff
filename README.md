MeshDiff is a graphical program (.NET + OpenTK) running on Windows operating systems which
allows its users to interactively view two homologous triangle meshes in .ply
or .obj format and visualize the difference between them. MeshDiff has various
color-based, arrow-based and combined visualizations available. Once the user
has found a visualization which suits their intentions the best, there are two
options of saving the visualization:

- It can be exported as a .ply file and subsequently loaded in any .ply viewer
- Its configuration can be saved. In this case, MeshDiff can load the configuration
and generate the very same visualization under the very same
viewing angle later

## User Documentation & More Information

All the necessary documentation and information can be found in my bachelor's thesis which this program supports. The thesis is located here: https://github.com/honzukka/Bachelor-Thesis.git
